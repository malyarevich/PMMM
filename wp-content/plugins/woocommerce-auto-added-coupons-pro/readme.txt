= Example: Auto coupon =

Let the customer have a discount of $ 5.00 when the cart reaches $ 50.00. 

1. Create a coupon, let's name it *auto_50bucks* and enter a short description e.g. *$ 50.00 order discount*
2. On the General tab: Select discount type *Cart discount*, and set the coupon amount to $ 5.00
3. On the Usage restrictions tab: Set minimum spend to $ 50.00 and check the *Auto coupon*-box

Voila! The discount will be applied when the customer reaches $ 50.00 and a descriptive message will be shown.

If the restrictions are no longer met, it will silently be removed from the cart.

= Example: Apply coupon via an URL =

Apply coupon through an url like this:

1. Use the url www.example.com/url-to-shop?apply_coupon=my_coupon

Voila! Any coupon can be applied this way.


This plugin has been tested in combination with WPML and qTranslate-X.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or automatically install it through the 'New Plugin' menu in WordPress
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= How to create an automatically added coupon? =

1. Create a coupon through the 'Coupons' menu in WooCommerce. TIP: Name it auto_'whatever' so it will be easy to recognize the auto coupons
2. Setup the coupon as you'd normally would. Make sure you enter a description for the coupon and set usage restrictions
3. In the "Miscellaneous" tab, check the box *Auto coupon*
4. Voila! That's it

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the plugin translatable? =

Yes, all string values are translatable through the supplied POT/PO/MO files. In WPML translatable items appear in the context `woocommerce-jos-autocoupon` in "String Translations".

= Why isn't my coupon applied using www.example.com?apply_coupon=my_coupon ? =

The coupon will only be applied if the url links to a WooCommerce page (e.g. product loop / cart / product detail ).

= The cart is not updated after changing the payment method =

In your theme add class "update_totals_on_change" to the container (div / p / whatever) that holds the payment method radio buttons.
You can do this by overriding woocommerce/templates/checkout/payment.php (place it in your_template/woocommerce/checkout/).

= The cart is not updated after changing the billing email address =

Paste this snippet in your theme's functions.php:
`
//Update the cart preview when the billing email is changed by the customer
add_filter( 'woocommerce_checkout_fields', function( $checkout_fields ) {
	$checkout_fields['billing']['billing_email']['class'][] = 'update_totals_on_change';
	return $checkout_fields;	
} );
`
