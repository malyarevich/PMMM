Set a language as a fallback for the chosen language (e.g. "Deutsch" as a fallback for "Deutsch (Sie)")

== Description ==

Starting with WordPress 4.3, you can use languages such as "Deutsch (Sie)" (formal German) in your WordPress installation. But if the themes or plugins you are using do not have a
translation file for this language, WordPress would use the default language, usually English, instead. With the help of this plugin, you can set a fallback for your chosen language.
Every time a translation file is loaded, the plugin will then load the fallback, if a translation for the originally chosen language was not found.

A list of all of my plugins can be found on the [WordPress Plugin page](http://kau-boys.com/wordpress-plugins "WordPress Plugins") on my blog [kau-boys.com](http://kau-boys.com).

== Installation ==

Install the plugin as usual from the plugins page on your dashboard (by search or uploaded ZIP file) or upload it with FTP. You should than choose your fallback language in "Settings > General".



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin only work with formal German? =

No. You can choose any fallback language that fits your original language. Think about fallbacks from "Spanish (Mexico)" to "Spanish".

= Do I need to manually install the fallback language? =

No. The plugin will automatically download the fallback language if it is not already installed.
