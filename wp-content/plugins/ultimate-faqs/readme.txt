= What attributes does the [ultimate-faqs] shortcode accept? =

The FAQ shortcode accepts two attributes, "include_category" and "exclude_category". Both take a comma-separated list of FAQ category slugs. For example, to include only FAQs about the Category "Cars" (which has a slug "cars"), you would use:

[ultimate-faqs include_category='cars']

You can now also use the 'include_category_ids' and 'exclude_category_ids' attributes, to let users include categories by ID instead of only by slug

= Can I hide my FAQ categories? =

Yes, you can choose to display or hide FAQ categories on the FAQ settings page.

= Is it possible to re-order my FAQs? =

Currently you can choose between ascending or descending ordering for your FAQ by either Title, Date Created, or Date Modified.

With the premium version, you can use the FAQ drag and drop ordering table to set exactly the order you want for your FAQs.

= How can I make my FAQs sharable over social media? =

On the FAQ settings page you can choose to link to twitter, facebook and more!

= How do I make my FAQs searchable? =

You can use the premium shortcode, [ultimate-faq-search], which displays an AJAX FAQ search form. You can use the "Auto-Complete Titles" option to have a list of all matching FAQ questions pop up when a user has typed 3 or more characters.

= Can I display all FAQs on pageload using the [ultimate-faq-search] shortcode? =

You can add the attribute "show_on_load" to the shortcode, and set it to "Yes" to display all FAQs when the page first loads.

= How do I add FAQs to a WooCommerce product page with the premium version? =

You can add FAQs for either a specific product or for a WooCommerce category.

For a specific product, create an FAQ category with the same name as the product, and then select that category for all of the FAQs you want included on your product page.

For a category of WooCommerce products, create an FAQ category with the same name as the WooCommerce category, and then select that category for all of the FAQs you want included on your product page.

= How do I limit the number of posts generated by a shortcode =

For the [ultimate-faqs], [popular-faqs] and [recent-faqs] shortcodes, you can use the post_count attribute to limit the number of posts shown. For example:

`[ultimate-faqs post_count='9']
`

= How do I customize my FAQs, for example, to change the font? =

You can customize the plugin by adding code to the Custom CSS box on the FAQ settings page, go to the "Custom CSS" box. For example to change the font you might want to add something like:

.ufaq-faq-title h4, .ufaq-faq-category-title h4  {font-family:"Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Palatino, serif;}

You can also use the "Styling" area of the "Options" tab if you're using the premium version, which has a bulit-in color picker for FAQ color fields and more!
