=== WooCommerce Recommendation Engine ===

WooCommerce Recommendation Engine is a smart recommendation engine for your store.  The recommendation engine uses product views and order history to automatically 
learn what shoppers might be interested in and show them recommendations on single product pages or in a widget in your sidebar.  WooCommerce recommendation engine works great as a replacement for manual cross sells, 
or can be used in addition to help promote and highlight products that other users view or purchase together. 
You can optionally choose to show or hide the different types of recommendation modules from the WooCommerce settings panel.   
The plugin also comes with a widget called WooCommerce Product Recommendations. The widget is similar to the related products widget, but will base the products it shows on Views and / or Purchase History which you can configure when adding the widget to a sidebar. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder 'woocommerce-recommender' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate 'WooCommerce Recommender' through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== About ==
WooCommerce Recommendation engine automatically shows products to users based on view history, purchase history and products that are frequently purchased together. 
It is a great way to provide for automatic cross and up sells, and will help users browse and purchase more products from your store.  

The three different types of recommendation modules provided are:
Related Products By View
	This module engine shows products that are frequently viewed together.  Each time someone views a product it is recorded in the 
	recommendation engine database.  This data is then processed by the engine and shows products which are often viewed together sorted by the most 
	viewed together. 

Related Products by Purchase History
	This module shows products that are often purchased by the same users.   The products do not need to be purchased at the same time. 
	This module is excellent for showing products which are purchased by the same users over the course of time.  It is a great way to get users
	to purchase more products at the same time by showing them things that other users have came back to the site to purchase later. 

Products Purchased Together
	This module shows products which are frequently purchased at the same time and on the same order.  This type of view is an 
	excellent way to build and show a database of products which are often needed together to complete an order.  Often times accessories or other type 
	of addons will be purchased at the same time by a user, and this engine will show those bundles to end users.
